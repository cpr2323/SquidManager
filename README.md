# SquidManager

A tool to manage Presets and Sample files for the ALM/Busy Circuits Squid Salmple

Currently requires JUCE version 7. The revision from 1/10/2024: 31dfb05ea3299176a416bf9258e030d04a099798

# Windows

There are no special steps to installing on Windows.

# OSX

Since the application is not signed (I don't want to pay the $99/yr) you will have to do a manual step in the console to allow it to run.

1. Download SquidManager.zip, the app will be automatically extracted during download.
2. Use the following command to allow it to run
3. **_xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/SquidManager.app_**
4. You can now run it. You can move it to the Applications folder if you do desire.

# Linux

There is no Linux version yet, but since we are using JUCE it should be _relative simple_.

# Thanks

Big thanks to Tait and Nick for helping me with beta testing.

Thanks to Ali the Architect for testing, advice, and the great icon.
